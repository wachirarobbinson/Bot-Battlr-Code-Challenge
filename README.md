## A. Description

Bot Battlr is a React application that allows users to build their own bot army by selecting bots from a collection and organizing them into their squad. The application displays a list of bots under the "Bot Collection" section, and users can click on a bot to add it to their army, which will then appear under the "Your Bot Army" section. If a bot needs to be removed from the army, it can be released by clicking on it again. Additionally, a bot can be permanently discharged by clicking the red "x" button.

### Features:

1. View profiles of all available bots on the website.
2. Add individual bots to your bot army by clicking on them.
3. Release a bot from your army by clicking on it again.
4. Permanently discharge a bot from your service by clicking the red "x" button.
